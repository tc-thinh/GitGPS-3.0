This program adopts Agile software engineering process, maybe a shortened version of it.

The process:
- Developer(s) will work on the branches based on the story's id, e.g. Story-001, and make a pull request to `dev` and assigned at least one reviewer.
- After being merged to `dev`, it will be pushed onto `main`. The app will be deployed on `main`.
